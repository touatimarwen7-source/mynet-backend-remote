## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack**: React 19 with Vite, i18next for internationalization

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: React Router v6 for client-side routing with role-based page access
- **i18n System**: react-i18next with simplified configuration, French as default language
- **RTL-First Design**: Full Right-to-Left layout support for Arabic language users with LTR fallback
- **Dark Mode Support**: Context-based theme switching with CSS variables
- **Component Organization**: 30+ pages organized by user role (auth, buyer, supplier, admin, shared)
- **State Management**: Local component state with Axios for server communication
- **Security Layer**: Client-side token management with automatic refresh, XSS protection
- **Design System**: Centralized CSS variables and design tokens for consistency
- **UX Components**: Toast notifications, tooltips, enhanced tables, micro-interactions, verified badges

**Rationale**: i18next is industry-standard for React i18n. French as primary language aligns with Tunisian market. RTL/Dark mode essential for global markets. Toast system reduces complexity vs. browser alerts. Verified badges enhance trust. Micro-interactions enhance user delight.

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack**: Node.js with Express.js REST API

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- **Microservices-Oriented Structure**: Controllers, services, and models separated into domain-specific modules
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic isolated in service classes
- **RBAC Implementation**: 5 roles (Admin, Buyer, Supplier, Accountant, Viewer) with 13 granular permissions
- **Middleware Pipeline**: IP tracking, authentication, authorization, feature flags, error handling
- **Security-First Design**: JWT (1-hour access, 7-day refresh), PBKDF2 hashing, AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling (30 max, 10 min idle), batch processing, indexed queries

**Rationale**: Express provides flexibility for REST API. Service layer enables testing and maintenance. RBAC ensures proper access control. Security measures meet enterprise requirements for procurement data.

### Data Storage Solutions

**Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon managed hosting)

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- **Relational Model**: 10+ normalized tables with foreign key constraints
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging with created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by
- **Soft Deletes**: is_deleted flag prevents data loss while maintaining referential integrity
- **JSONB Fields**: Flexible storage for attachments, evaluation criteria, preferences
- **Timestamp Precision**: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE for server-time enforcement
- **Archive Policy**: 7-year retention with automated archival system

**Rationale**: PostgreSQL provides ACID transactions for financial integrity. JSONB offers schema flexibility. Server-time enforcement prevents manipulation. Audit logging meets compliance requirements.
