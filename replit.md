# MyNet.tn - B2B Procurement Platform

## Overview
MyNet.tn is a production-ready B2B procurement platform for the Tunisian private sector, designed for scalability and market leadership. It offers a secure and efficient solution for B2B transactions, including tender and offer management, dynamic company profiles, and a complete supply chain process from tender creation to invoice generation. The platform aims to provide a unified institutional theme, enterprise-grade security, and a professional user experience, positioning itself for market leadership in B2B e-procurement.

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language and clear explanations. I want iterative development with small, testable changes. Please ask before making any major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies. I prefer that the agent works in the `/frontend` directory and does not make changes in the `/backend` directory.

## System Architecture
The platform utilizes a React frontend (Vite) and a Node.js backend with a PostgreSQL database.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Design Principle**: All styles are defined via `frontend/src/theme/theme.js` using Material-UI (MUI), ensuring a unified institutional theme.
- **Color Palette**: #0056B3 (primary), #F9F9F9 (background), #212121 (text).
- **Styling**: 4px border radius, 8px spacing, Roboto font.
- **Localization**: FRANÇAIS UNIQUEMENT.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint guidelines, touch target sizes, responsive typography, and flexible grid layouts.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant with ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, and color contrast compliance.
- **User Experience**: Loading skeletons for improved data loading UX.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite.
- **Backend**: Node.js 20 + Express.
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens + httpOnly cookies, 3-layer token persistence, MFA (SMS & TOTP).
- **Security**: CORS, CSRF, XSS, AES-256 encryption, rate limiting, brute-force protection, input validation, soft deletes, role-based access control.
- **Workflow Management**: Multi-step wizard forms for procurement processes with auto-save, draft recovery, validation, and progress tracking.
- **Core Features**: Dynamic company profiles, advanced filtering & search, messaging, reviews & ratings, direct supply requests, analytics dashboards, bid comparison tool, supplier performance tracking, and comprehensive invoice management.
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket (socket.io) for live notifications, bidirectional communication, and instant user presence updates via `useWebSocket` hook with comprehensive event management.
- **Data Management**: Export features (JSON, CSV), real-time updates via WebSockets, pagination, and bulk operations.
- **Notifications**: Integrated email notification system + Real-time notification center with WebSocket events.
- **Super Admin Features**: Full CRUD for static pages, file management, image gallery, documents with versioning, content backup/restore, analytics, service/subscription plan management, audit logs, purchase orders.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive system with custom error classes, global handler, error boundary, and Axios interceptors.
- **Form Validation**: Custom `useFormValidation` hook, pre-built schemas, real-time error display, and backend error integration.
- **Performance & Monitoring**: Three-layer optimization (database indexes, comprehensive caching with Redis, distributed caching), centralized error tracking, logging, comprehensive test suite (50%+ coverage), and automated daily database backups.
- **API Documentation**: Integrated Swagger UI with OpenAPI 3.0 specification for 95+ endpoints.
- **Enhanced Rate Limiting**: Multi-strategy (IP-based, per-user, endpoint-specific) rate limiting with configurable rules and monitoring.

### System Design Choices
- **Database Connection**: Optimized PostgreSQL connection pool with `SafeClient` wrapper and safe query middleware.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implemented CSRF protection, field-level access control, optimistic locking, and comprehensive rate limiting.
- **Code Quality**: Refactored components, eliminated code duplication, and introduced reusable components (AdminDialog, AdminForm, AdminTable, SkeletonLoader).
- **Architectural Patterns**: Use of `withTransaction()` for atomic database operations, `ErrorBoundary` for UI resilience, and `asyncHandler` for robust route error catching.
- **Critical Fixes**: Addressed database connection pool errors, implemented comprehensive input validation and SQL injection prevention, enforced pagination limits, and integrated automated daily database backups.
- **Production Code Quality**: Removed console.log statements, implemented Privacy Policy & Terms of Service pages, added a response validation layer, and enhanced Axios interceptors.
- **Unified Pagination System**: Helper function `paginationHelper.js` with consistent validation and application across routes.
- **Query Optimization**: Documented patterns and fixes for N+1 issues using LEFT JOINs and aggregations.
- **Secure Key Management**: `keyManagementHelper.js` for secure environment variable loading, validation, and key rotation support.

## External Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon).
- **Frontend Libraries**: Material-UI (MUI), React Router DOM, Axios, i18next, socket.io-client.
- **Backend Libraries**: Express, Node.js, cors, express-rate-limit, node-schedule, jest, socket.io, Redis.
- **Email Services**: SendGrid/Resend/Gmail (integrated notification system).
- **Testing**: Jest 29.7.0 with coverage reporting.
- **Monitoring**: Error tracking service, performance middleware, request logging, Swagger UI.
## Lots & Articles Structure - November 23, 2025

### 🎯 Implementation Complete

✅ **Lots as Article Collections**
- Each Lot contains multiple Articles (products/services)
- Each Article has: name, quantity, unit (unité, kg, litre, m, m², boîte)
- Lot structure: numero, objet (description), articles array

✅ **Flexible Award Levels (ترسية)**
- **Par Lot**: Entire lot awarded to one supplier
- **Par Article**: Each article can go to different supplier
- **Global**: Entire tender to one supplier
- Award level displayed in summary and sent with tender creation

✅ **UI/UX Implementation**
- Step 3 (Lots): Create Lots with nested article management
- Award Level selector with color-coded options
- Real-time article list in each lot
- Step 7 (Preview): Shows award level + detailed lots with articles
- Validation: Minimum 1 lot required, each lot must have articles

✅ **Example Structure**
```
Lot 1: Informatique
  - Article 1: 5 imprimante laser
  - Article 2: 3 scanner HP

Lot 2: Fournitures de Bureau
  - Article 1: 20 stylo bleu
  - Article 2: 5 stylo rouge
```

✅ **Data Model**

{
  awardLevel: 'lot', // or 'article', 'tender'
  lots: [
    {
      numero: '1',
