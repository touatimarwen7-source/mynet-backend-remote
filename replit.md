# MyNet.tn - B2B Procurement Platform

## Overview
MyNet.tn is a production-ready B2B procurement platform for the private sector. It provides a robust, secure, and efficient solution for B2B transactions, encompassing tender management, offer management, dynamic company profiles, and a complete supply chain process from tender creation to invoice generation. The platform features a unified institutional theme, enterprise-grade security, and a professional user experience, designed for scalability and market leadership in B2B procurement.

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language and clear explanations. I want iterative development with small, testable changes. Please ask before making any major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies. I prefer that the agent works in the `/frontend` directory and does not make changes in the `/backend` directory.

## System Architecture
The platform utilizes a React frontend (Vite) and a Node.js backend with a PostgreSQL database.
